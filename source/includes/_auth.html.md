# Authentication

<aside class="notice">Work in progress</aside>

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
```

```python
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: <YourAuthorizationToken>"
```

> Make sure to replace `<YourAuthorizationToken>` with your authorization token.

Load Impact expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization:Token <YourAuthorizationToken>`
