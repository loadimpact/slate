# Introduction

[WIP] This API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate).

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
```

```python
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: Your_API_Token"
```

> Make sure to replace `Your_API_Token` with your API token.

Load Impact expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Your_API_Token`
